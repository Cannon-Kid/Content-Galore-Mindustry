- Currently testing Foil in Alpha v0.1

Total things finished: 2

Have I figured out GitHub: No

Will I figure out GitHub: Probably never

Item Cadmium: Used in power-related things, as well as metal coating, alloys, and pigments.

Item Tin: Used to coat other metals, stopping corrosion. It can also make metals superconductable.

Turret Foil: Shoots pure electricity lightning. Great at handling low-tier units without needing items. Horrible at defending against strong enemies. When many other Foil turrets are placed, they can dish out lots of damage together.
