Total things finished: 15

Item | Cadmium: Used in power-related things, as well as metal coating, alloys, and pigments.

Item | Tin: Used to coat other metals, stopping corrosion. It can also make metals superconductable.

Turret | Foil: Shoots pure electricity lightning. Great at handling low-tier units without needing items. Horrible at defending against strong enemies. When many other Foil turrets are placed, they can dish out lots of damage together.

Production | Tin Modeler: Creates tin from copper and lead. Studies don't show how this is possible, but it might be from the power inputted and the machinery that it uses.

Turret | Jaws: Don't get this turret confused with mere animals or movies, because this turret is dangerous. Fires clumps of bullets at enemies with inaccuracy. Powerful alone, even deadlier in groups.

Planet | Minorsurplus: A small, weird planet. Reality-breaking power was detected here.

Sector | Harvest: A tiny crater, found out to be the only safe landing spot on Minorsurplus without causing all hell to break out. Though, a few Crux units may spot you here. Gather resourses, defend, then launch to the next sector.

Unit | Nadir: A Zenith-like unit that is stronger than the regular Zenith. But... It certainly looks odd. Like it's corrupt.

Sector | EXPERIMENT 001: NO DATA FOUND

Unit | Orbit: A very HEAVILY protected hard-to-take-out unit. Self-heals. Also shoots lasers that slow speed and slow reload speed. Cool.

Sector | The Snow Pit: One of the only small, snowy sectors. Sports good resourses. Defend against 20 waves, with an air raid on wave 10, and a ground raid on wave 20. This can be a useful sector when captured.

Unit | Extinguish: Extinguish is a better version of Flare. Although Extinguish has less hitpoints, everything else is upgraded, including Extinguish's carry capacity. Flare is known as the annoying fly, but Extinguish takes it a step further.

Unit | Nexus: Horizon, but it decided carpet bombing was more fun, and hitpoints suck. Now with more bombs, and lots of frag bullets to top it off.

Unit | Lag: Lag is a type of Poly, but instead of being support, it trades off most of it's supporting qualities for more offense. However, Lag retains it's healing ability. Also, don't worry, Lag is able to carry items, meaning spore bombing is an option!

Sector | EXPERIMENT 029: NO DATA FOUND
