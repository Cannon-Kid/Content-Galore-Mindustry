Total things finished: 4

Item | Cadmium: Used in power-related things, as well as metal coating, alloys, and pigments.

Item | Tin: Used to coat other metals, stopping corrosion. It can also make metals superconductable.

Turret | Foil: Shoots pure electricity lightning. Great at handling low-tier units without needing items. Horrible at defending against strong enemies. When many other Foil turrets are placed, they can dish out lots of damage together.

Production | Tin Modeler: Creates tin from copper and lead. Studies don't show how this is possible, but it might be from the power inputted and the machinery that it uses.

Turret | Jaws
