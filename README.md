- Currently working on Cadmium and Foil
- Cadmium is a resourse used to create power-related things.
- Foil is a T1 turret that shoots bullets of electricity that deal single target damage and apply Shocked to targeted enemies. It consumes not a lot of power, but in return has low DPS. Foil can be cooled with water and cryofluid.
